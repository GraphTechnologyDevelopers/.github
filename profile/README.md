**Hands-on graph databases, knowledge graphs, and GNNs.** Share schemas, queries, datasets, and real-world modeling patterns. Get feedback, collaborate, and learn together.

## 🌐 What We Do

We're a community of developers building with graph technology:

- **Graph Databases** - Property graphs, knowledge graphs, and graph storage systems
- **Query Languages** - Cypher, GQL, RDF/SPARQL, and graph query patterns
- **Graph Neural Networks** - GNN architectures, training, and applications
- **Graph Modeling** - Schema design, performance optimization, and best practices
- **Educational Resources** - Tutorials, templates, datasets, and real-world examples
